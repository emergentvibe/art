            <p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://x.com/emergentvibe" target="_blank">Emergent</a>!</p>
            <p>I create and facilitate experiences that inspire creativity and collective joy. Art workshops are one of my favorite ways to bring people together!</p>

        <section class="experience">
            <p>I've run collaborative painting workshops at various events, <a href="https://portal-porto.brick.do/" target="_blank">Portal</a>, <a href="https://simonohler.com/treeweek" target="_blank">TreeWeek</a>, yincubator, and recently run one open to the public in Amsterdam!</p>

        <section class="intention">
            <p>My intention is to provide a safe space for people to let go of preconceived ideas of what art is or should look like, what makes art "good" or "valuable". A space where people can freely express their feelings and the surrounding environment via color and motion. The end result - a vibe landscape of the inner and outer world, capturing the essence of the vibecamp gathering!</p>

        <section class="workshop-details">
            <p>I love getting people to collaborate on a large canvas together. My workshop usually starts with a spiel about logistics and basic technique. Once everyone is up to speed, we begin with a short meditation to access our inner child/inner artist, and to allow ourselves to create freely. I'm available throughout the workshop to help, and add details throughout the painting, as well as coordinating collaboration by suggesting people to move around different sections of the canvas.</p>
            
            <p>I help participants to fully surrender to their creative spirits, and to work with their inner critic and temporarily quieten the voice that says "I am not good at this". The other instruction I give to participants is to "capture the vibe", referring to the vibe of the space around them and their inner world. This way, at the end we have an artwork that represents the place and time of its creation - a captured vibe.</p>
            
            <p>The style that emerges is very abstract expressionism-like. In the past, we've distributed artworks to participants - at TreeWeek we cut up the painting and everyone took a piece home.</p>

                    <p>For <a href="https://vibe.camp/" target="_blank">vibecamp</a>, I wish to create 4 5x5ft canvases, and to then have them distributed to tpot spaces around the globe. This could start a great tradition and art scene, and these works of art could be a beacon of the culture we are developing.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>4 5x5ft canvases would allow 6-8 people per canvas, for a total of 25 simultaneous people.</p>
            
            <p>Normally this workshop goes on for a few hours, and people come and go and keep adding details, increasing the number of total participants.</p>
